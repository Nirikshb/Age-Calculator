# Age-Calculator

Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
Receive validation errors if:
Any field is empty when the form is submitted
The day number is not between 1-31
The month number is not between 1-12
The year is in the future
The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
